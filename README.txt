Project Overview: This stems from a software engineering project I worked on for school and is meant to be a fully functional virtual stock exchange.
It is my goal to open it up to people who might be interested in developing their own software along these lines and might need some guidance on how to do it.
As of right now, I am figuring out where to go next. There are some bugs which need to be fixed. Other routes I am looking at is some how incorporating
statisical tools to help someone analyize their stock movements. Besides that their are ideas and those ideas need implementation. I am open to both - ideas and implementations.
Contact me at kevinwestropp@live.com if you have comments or other questions.   

License: I have included no license with this project for two reasons. 
One is that I do not feel it is necessary to have to include a document that most people will ignore anyways. 
The other reason is that I want to get this out and make this project available for anybody that interested and do not want to hinder someone.
Having said that, It is not my intention for people to use this in place of their own work, whether it be for school or for something else.
I am very much open to anyone looking at, downloading, altering, tinkering with and otherwise using to improve their understanding of Java
and stock markets, but cheating is not one of them. Otherwise it is fair game.
